As a venue for visual art, music, interviews, fiction and poetry it has provided me with a way to continually improve my chops across the board. Design, development, audio & video editing, podcasting and brand development are just a few of the things I handle on a regular basis. It has been the unmoving rock that I use to learn new things, test new technologies and keep myself honest. Fogged Clarity is built on Wordpress using a custom theme that turns the CMS into an issue-based publication and allows editors to do as much as possible without my help.",

I ended up swamped with client work and was unable to continue with the official submission, but afterwards I continued building my idea. This demo shows incoming and outgoing data from Divvy stations over a period of 24 hours. I utilized Leaflet and d3.js for the data projection and GSAP for animation. I've narrowed down the data set to a single day (July 4th, 2013) for the purposes of demonstration and performance. Clear patterns emerge showing that some stations have disproportionate incoming or outgoing traffic.",
